# Contributing
1. Always use a seperate branch and then pull request that into the main branch. Never push directly to main. This allows easy changelog generation and makes everything simpler :)
2. Most of this code is from a developer who no longer works on this project. Feel free to renovate the code style most of the time unless otherwise stated
